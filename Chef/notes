Chef
====
Programmatically provision.

Server - hosted or in-house. Another option is AWS OpsWorks

Terminology
===========
Organization: Chef server can have multiple tenant organizations.
Each organization can represent business units or departments or so on.

Environments: within each organization - Development, staging, production. 

Nodes: Represent servers (hosts in ansible)
Each node belongs one environment.

Roles : types of nodes - db server, VPN server, app server etc
Include run list: list of chef config files to be applied,
    and data attributes: IPs ports etc

Chef-client : runs on each node, configures node according to policy set by chef server

Resource : a piece of a system and its desired state. eg: package to be installed, service to be run. 
These are building blocks of chef config. Included in recipes.


Recipes: config files-describe resources and their desired state
Recipes - playbooks in ansible
They can install and config software components, manage files, deploy apps. Can depend on other recipes

Recipe syntax
-------------
eg: Install and start nginx - recipe 1 (depends on apt)

include_recipe 'apt'

package 'nginx' do
  action :install
end

service 'nginx' do
  action [:enable, :start]
end

Cookbooks : Recipe collection
Can have templates, files, custom resources etc. Code re-useand modularity. 

Search : search for nodes with roles. find topology data - ip, hostname, fully qualified dns etc. query from chef server

Config drift - when infrastructure requirement changes, change policies in server. Client pulls new policies and enforces it on nodes.

Chef knife
==========
command line tool: interface btwn local chef files and chef server

Setting up : using new vagrant file start an ubuntu trusty workstation(chef-demo). ssh into it
Install Chef dev toolkit : download from chef.io and save in vagrant folder. Install in workstation with dpkg -i as root

Set up Knife: 
create .chef dir in home folder and in it, to a file knife.rb add cookbook_path['home/vagrant/cookbooks']

Creating a cookbook:
Cookbook dir structure in the workstation:
 mkdir cookbooks
 cd cookbooks
 chef generate cookbook my_cookbook

In my_cookbook/recipes/metadata.rb : write script to install nginx and run it. Also change html/index.html file for nginx to display 'hello world'

To apply the recipe:
  sudo chef-client -z --runlist 'recipe[my_cookbook]'

But first resolve dependencies and Package recipe:
To download dependencies, initialize berks file form my_cookbook dir:
  berks init #deprecated use chef generate cookbook instead
  echo 'cookbook "apt"' >> Berksfile
  BERKSHELF_PATH=~/cookbooks berks install

To package all cookbooks for distribution:
  berks vendor
  ls berks-cookbooks/

  mv berks-cookbooks/apt ~/cookbooks 
#this is the path we mentioned in knife.rb file as cookbook_path

Now that apt is resolved, run:
  sudo chef-client -z --runlist 'recipe[my_cookbook]'

This will install and start nginx. To verify 
  curl localhost

We should be able to see the 'Hello World'
